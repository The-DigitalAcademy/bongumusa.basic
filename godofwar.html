      <h1>God of War</h1>
      </p>
      <p>A STORY OF FATHER AND SON
        It is a new beginning for Kratos. Living as a man, outside the shadow of the gods, he seeks solitude in the
        unfamiliar lands of Norse mythology. With new purpose and his son at his side, Kratos must fight for survival as
        powerful forces threaten to disrupt the new life he has created…

        Bold New Beginning
        His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods
        and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive… And teach his son to do the
        same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying
        combat, breathtaking scale, and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew.</p>
